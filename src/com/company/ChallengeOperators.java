/*
1. double MealCost = the user input, this will be the original cost of the meal that the user enters.
In order to do this we need to do sc.nextDouble().
    System.out.println ("Enter you Meal Cost: ")
2. int TipRate = 0.15 * MealCost, this sets the tip rate at 15%.
3. int TaxRate = 0.15 * MealCost, this sets the tax rate at 15%.
4. int TotalCost = TipRate + TaxRate + MealCost.
5. System.out.println ("Tip: " + TipRate)
6. System.out.println ("Tax: " + TaxRate)
7. System.out.println ("Total " + TotalCost)
